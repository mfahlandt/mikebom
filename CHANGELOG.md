# Changelog

All notable changes to mikebom are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once it exits
`0.1.x` alpha.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Milestone 030 — Mach-O codesign metadata.** Every Mach-O scan
  now extracts three identity-flavored signals from the
  `LC_CODE_SIGNATURE` (cmd `0x1D`) SuperBlob's CodeDirectory blob:
  `mikebom:macho-codesign-identifier` (e.g. `com.apple.ls` —
  universal across Apple-signed binaries),
  `mikebom:macho-codesign-flags` (JSON array decoded from
  `CodeDirectory.flags` — `hardened-runtime`, `library-validation`,
  `adhoc`, etc.; unrecognized bits emit as `unknown-0x<hex>`), and
  `mikebom:macho-codesign-team-id` (10-char Apple Team ID for
  developer-signed binaries; absent for Apple-system signatures
  whose `TeamIdentifier=not set` and for ad-hoc signatures). This
  is what `codesign -dvv` reads. Fat / universal binaries report
  from the first slice (matching milestone 024's convention).
  **Sixth amortization-proof consumer of the milestone-023
  `extra_annotations` bag** (after 023/024/025/028/029 — 026 was
  a coverage-breadth milestone that didn't touch the bag). No new
  crate dependencies. CMS PKCS#7 cert-chain decoding (which would
  extract the leaf-cert subject CN, signing time, intermediate
  cert hashes — requires ASN.1 DER parsing) and entitlements XML
  extraction explicitly deferred to a follow-on milestone (likely
  unified with PE Authenticode, which has the same DER-parsing
  requirement). See `specs/030-macho-codesign-metadata/spec.md`
  and catalog rows C37/C38/C39 in
  `docs/reference/sbom-format-mapping.md`.
- **Milestone 029 — cargo-auditable extraction.** Extracts the
  zlib-compressed JSON manifest from Rust binaries' `.dep-v0` linker
  section ([cargo-auditable](https://github.com/rust-secure-code/cargo-auditable)
  format) and surfaces the full build-time crate dependency closure as
  per-crate `pkg:cargo/<name>@<version>` components with
  `evidence-kind = "cargo-auditable"`, `confidence = "high"`,
  `parent_purl` cross-linking back to the file-level binary, and
  index-based `dependencies` resolved into `depends` edges. The binary
  itself gains a `mikebom:detected-cargo-auditable = true` cross-link
  annotation (Rust analog of milestone 005's `mikebom:detected-go =
  true`). Cargo wrappers in Debian Trixie+, Fedora 40+, Alpine Edge,
  and the official Rust container images auto-enable the embedding —
  so most Rust binaries built in those environments now surface their
  full statically-linked crate closure without source access. Cross-
  format: ELF / Mach-O / PE. Optional bag annotations
  `mikebom:cargo-auditable-source` (non-registry sources) and
  `mikebom:cargo-auditable-kind` (non-runtime kinds) preserve
  manifest detail. **Fifth amortization-proof consumer of the
  milestone-023 `extra_annotations` bag** (after 023/024/025/028 —
  026 was a coverage-breadth milestone that didn't touch the bag).
  No new crate dependencies — `flate2` and `serde_json` were already
  in the workspace. See `specs/029-cargo-auditable-extraction/spec.md`
  and catalog row C36 in `docs/reference/sbom-format-mapping.md`.
- **Milestone 026 — curated version-string scanner expansion (easy-4
  cohort).** Extends `version_strings.rs`'s curated scanner from 7 to
  **11 self-identifying native libraries**. Four new detectors with
  clean self-identifying signatures in the binary's read-only string
  region:
  - **GnuTLS** (`GnuTLS X.Y.Z`) — common in curl-with-GnuTLS, wget,
    GnuPG, GNU-stack tools.
  - **LibreSSL** (`LibreSSL X.Y.Z`) — macOS system tools (system curl
    was LibreSSL-backed for years), OpenBSD-derived utilities.
  - **LLVM** (`LLVM version X.Y.Z`) — strict prefix; bare `LLVM ` is
    too noisy (matches `LLVM ERROR:`, `LLVM IR ...` etc.).
  - **OpenJDK** — two-scheme parser handling both modern JEP 322
    (`21.0.1+12`) and legacy Java 8 (`8u362-b09`).

  Each match emits a `pkg:generic/<library>@<version>` component with
  `mikebom:evidence-kind = "embedded-version-string"` and
  `mikebom:confidence = "heuristic"`, flowing through the existing
  `version_match_to_entry` machinery (no downstream wiring change).
  9 new inline tests cover positive + negative cases per library
  plus a `libressl_distinct_from_openssl` cross-validation test.

  Three additional libraries from the original wishlist (glibc, musl,
  V8) are deferred to a 026.x research-and-attempt follow-on because
  they don't have clean self-identifying strings in `string_region` —
  glibc's `GLIBC_X.Y` lives in the `.gnu.version_r` ELF section, musl
  rarely self-identifies in compiled output, and V8's version strings
  are buried in stack-trace formatting code. Tracked via
  `TODO(milestone-026.x)` in `version_strings.rs` and the
  "Deferred backlog" section of `docs/design-notes.md`. See
  `specs/026-version-string-library-expansion/spec.md`.

  Note: this milestone is **not** a `extra_annotations` bag consumer —
  it produces new components rather than annotations on existing
  components. The bag-amortization streak from 023/024/025/028 stays
  at four; 026 is purely scanner coverage breadth.
- **Milestone 028 — PE binary identity.** Every Windows-binary scan
  now surfaces three identity signals via `object` 0.36's typed PE
  accessors: `mikebom:pe-pdb-id` (the `<guid-hex-lowercase>:<age>`
  pair from the CodeView Type-2 record in `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DEBUG`
  — the canonical PE binary identity used by Microsoft Symbol Server,
  Mozilla / Chromium symbol stores, WinDbg, drmingw; analog of
  Linux's NT_GNU_BUILD_ID and macOS's LC_UUID), `mikebom:pe-machine`
  (lowercase `IMAGE_FILE_HEADER.Machine` — `amd64` / `i386` /
  `arm64` / `armnt` / `ia64` / `riscv32` / `riscv64` / `unknown`),
  and `mikebom:pe-subsystem` (lowercase
  `IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.Subsystem` — `console` / `windows-gui` /
  `efi-application` / `native` / etc., with `WINDOWS_CUI` rendering
  as `console` per Microsoft toolchain idiom). PE32 vs PE32+
  bit-width is auto-dispatched by reading
  `IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.Magic` (`0x10B` vs `0x20B`). With ELF (023)
  and Mach-O (024) already shipping, this completes the binary-
  identity trifecta — every compiled binary mikebom scans now
  carries cross-platform identity in the SBOM. Surfaced via the
  milestone-023 generic annotation bag — the **fourth** amortization-
  proof consumer, with zero churn in `package_db/`, `mikebom-common/`,
  `cli/`, `resolve/`, `generate/`, `elf.rs`, or `macho.rs`. See
  `specs/028-pe-binary-identity/spec.md` and catalog rows
  C33/C34/C35 in `docs/reference/sbom-format-mapping.md`.
- **Milestone 024 — Mach-O binary identity.** Every macOS-binary
  scan now surfaces three identity signals from byte-level Mach-O
  load-command parsing: `mikebom:macho-uuid` (16-byte LC_UUID
  hex-encoded lowercase — the macOS analog of NT_GNU_BUILD_ID; used
  by `dwarfdump`, `xcrun symbolicatecrash`, the macOS crash reporter,
  and every `*.dSYM` bundle for symbol matching),
  `mikebom:macho-rpath` (LC_RPATH paths in declaration order, dedup'd
  — `@executable_path` / `@loader_path` / `@rpath` recorded raw,
  runtime-context-dependent expansion deferred to consumers), and
  `mikebom:macho-min-os` (`<platform>:<version>` shape — e.g.
  `macos:14.0`, `ios:17.5` — preferring `LC_BUILD_VERSION`, falling
  back to `LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX` / `LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS` /
  `LC_VERSION_MIN_TVOS` / `LC_VERSION_MIN_WATCHOS`). Fat / universal
  Mach-O binaries report from the FIRST slice's bytes (per-slice
  arch-divergence is uncommon in practice; consumers needing it can
  fall back to `otool -l <slice>`). SC-002 verified on the macOS CI
  lane: `/bin/ls` scan emits a non-empty 32-lowercase-hex
  `mikebom:macho-uuid` and a non-empty `<platform>:<version>`
  `mikebom:macho-min-os` — both universal on every supported macOS
  version. Surfaced via the milestone-023 generic annotation bag,
  with zero PackageDbEntry-init churn (the bag's amortization
  payoff). 3 atomic commits; see `specs/024-macho-binary-identity/spec.md`
  and catalog rows C30/C31/C32 in `docs/reference/sbom-format-mapping.md`.
- **Milestone 025 — Go BuildInfo VCS metadata.** Every Go-binary scan
  now surfaces the source-tree VCS state recorded at build time. The
  main-module entry (`pkg:golang/<module>@<version>`) gains three new
  annotations across CDX / SPDX 2.3 / SPDX 3:
  `mikebom:go-vcs-revision` (commit SHA from `vcs.revision`),
  `mikebom:go-vcs-time` (RFC 3339 commit timestamp from `vcs.time`),
  `mikebom:go-vcs-modified` (dirty-tree boolean from `vcs.modified`,
  preserved as the literal string `"true"` / `"false"` matching Go's
  wire format). The data was already present in BuildInfo's vers_info
  blob; pre-025 the parser read only the first line (Go version) and
  discarded the rest. Dep modules don't carry VCS info — it's a
  main-module concern. Surfaced via the milestone-023 generic
  annotation bag, with zero PackageDbEntry-init churn or generate/
  plumbing changes (the bag's amortization payoff). 4 atomic commits;
  see `specs/025-go-vcs-metadata/spec.md` and catalog rows C27/C28/C29
  in `docs/reference/sbom-format-mapping.md`.
- **Milestone 023 — ELF binary identity + per-component generic
  annotation bag.** Two cohorts in one milestone. (a) ELF identity:
  every Linux-binary scan now surfaces `NT_GNU_BUILD_ID` (the
  canonical Linux binary-identity hash used by `eu-unstrip`,
  `coredumpctl`, `debuginfod`, `*-dbgsym` packaging), `DT_RPATH` /
  `DT_RUNPATH` (embedded library search paths the dynamic loader
  consults — `$ORIGIN` etc. recorded raw), and `.gnu_debuglink`
  (pointer to the stripped-debug sibling file). Three new annotations
  on the file-level binary component: `mikebom:elf-build-id`,
  `mikebom:elf-runpath`, `mikebom:elf-debuglink`. SC-002 is satisfied
  on Linux CI: `/bin/ls` scan emits a non-empty hex build-id (every
  modern distro stamps build-ids by default). (b) Per-component
  annotation bag: `extra_annotations: BTreeMap<String, Value>` on
  `PackageDbEntry` and `ResolvedComponent` provides a generic per-
  component annotation channel that future per-binary-metadata
  milestones (024 Mach-O LC_UUID, 026 version-string library
  expansion, 027 container layer attribution) can populate without
  per-field schema migration. Determinism is preserved by `BTreeMap`
  iteration order. Catalog rows C24/C25/C26.

- **Milestone 010 — SPDX 2.3 output + OpenVEX sidecar + SPDX 3.0.1
  experimental stub.** SPDX 2.3 JSON is now a peer of CycloneDX across
  all 9 supported ecosystems. A single `mikebom sbom scan` invocation
  can emit both formats from one pass over the target; the new
  `--format` flag accepts a comma-separated list and is repeatable,
  and `--output` accepts either a bare path (single-format, legacy)
  or repeated `<fmt>=<path>` (per-format). Every data element that
  CDX emits has a documented target in SPDX — native field where the
  spec has one, `annotations[]` entry with a `mikebom-annotation/v1`
  JSON envelope for the rest; the full map is at
  `docs/reference/sbom-format-mapping.md`. When a scan produces
  advisory data, SPDX 2.3 emission co-emits a companion OpenVEX 0.2.0
  JSON sidecar referenced from the SPDX document via
  `externalDocumentRefs` with a SHA-256 of the sidecar bytes;
  `--output openvex=<path>` retargets it (legal only alongside an
  SPDX format). A third, opt-in format `spdx-3-json-experimental`
  emits a minimal SPDX 3.0.1 JSON-LD document for npm components —
  clearly labeled `[EXPERIMENTAL]` in `--help`, in error messages,
  and in the document's own `CreationInfo.comment`. Typing bare
  `spdx-3-json` offers a did-you-mean hint. No behavior change for
  users who don't request SPDX output: CycloneDX emission is
  byte-identical to the pre-milestone baseline, guarded by pinned
  golden fixtures and a dedicated regression test.
  See `specs/010-spdx-output-support/spec.md` for the full
  requirement list and `docs/reference/sbom-format-mapping.md` for
  the cross-format data-placement contract.
- **Feature 009 refinement — bytecode-presence gating for Maven
  shade-relocation.** Shade-relocation entries are now emitted only when
  an ancestor's bytecode is verifiably present in the enclosing JAR
  (either at its original group path or at a shade-relocated path whose
  leaf matches a distinctive artifact-id fragment). Apache's
  `maven-dependency-plugin` emits `META-INF/DEPENDENCIES` into any JAR
  it is configured on, not only shade fat-jars, so the pre-gating
  emission path reported ancestors as "present in" JARs whose bytecode
  was never relocated there. New unit + integration tests exercise
  every disposition. See `specs/009-maven-shade-deps/spec.md` FR-002b.

### Changed
- **`oci-registry` Cargo feature is now on by default.** Direct
  registry pulls (`mikebom sbom scan --image alpine:3.19`) work
  out of the box on a stock `cargo install mikebom` — matches
  syft / trivy UX without requiring `--features oci-registry`.
  The post-milestone-032 substrate (`oci-spec` types-only +
  workspace `reqwest 0.12` + mikebom-owned thin HTTP client) is
  small enough + durable enough that the milestone-031 default-off
  framing no longer pays for itself. Users embedding mikebom in a
  context that needs a minimal-deps build can opt out via
  `cargo install mikebom --no-default-features`; the local
  `--path <dir>` and `--image <foo.tar>` paths still work in that
  configuration. The dep-audit guardrail
  (`no_c_dependencies_in_oci_registry_feature_tree` regression
  test) continues to enforce zero new C-bound transitive deps in
  the now-default tree.

### Removed
- **`mikebom sbom compare` subcommand** and the `demos/` directory.
  The head-to-head comparison story is now owned by a separate test
  suite outside this repo; keeping the in-tree version invited drift
  between the two. Any workflow that depended on `sbom compare`
  should move to the external suite.

## [0.1.0-alpha.3] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Feature 009 US1 — shade-relocation ancestor emission.** When a JAR
  contains `META-INF/DEPENDENCIES`, mikebom emits one nested
  `pkg:maven/...` component per declared ancestor, nested under the
  enclosing JAR's primary coord and tagged with
  `mikebom:shade-relocation = true`. Ancestor licenses are parsed from
  the adjacent `License:` lines. Classifier-bearing coords preserve
  `?classifier=<value>` in the PURL. Self-references are dropped
  (`com.example:outer` cannot shade itself). Commit `cdf29b0`.
- **Feature 008 US3 — Maven target/-dir path heuristic** for
  suppressing `target/`-staged development artifacts from image scans.
  Commit `701ea50` (#14).
- **Feature 008 US2 — cache-ZIP Go component filter.** Emissions from
  Go module-cache ZIPs are cross-checked against the linked binary's
  `runtime/debug.BuildInfo`, suppressing ZIPs that never made it into
  the shipped binary. Commit `db6fbab` (#13).
- **Feature 007 US1 — Fedora sidecar POM reading.** JARs installed by
  `dnf` that have stripped embedded `META-INF/maven/` metadata now
  fall back to `/usr/share/maven-poms/` sidecar POMs (JPP-prefixed
  and plain). Commit `a06b7ff` (#8).
- **Feature 007 US2+US3 — Go test-scope and main-module filters.**
  go.sum and BuildInfo emissions are filtered against non-`_test.go`
  import closure and against the primary module's self-coord. Commit
  `b06eda8` (#10).
- **Feature 007 US4 — Main-Class executable-JAR self-reference
  suppression.** JARs whose `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` names a `Main-Class`
  no longer re-emit their own primary coord as a generic-binary
  `pkg:generic/...` entry. Commit `89a334f` (#11).
- **Feature 006 US5 — SBOM enrichment (`mikebom sbom enrich`).**
  RFC 6902 JSON Patch applier with per-patch provenance recorded as
  `mikebom:enrichment-patch[N]` properties on the BOM metadata. Replaces
  a previously stubbed bail.
- **Feature 006 US4 — in-toto policy layouts (`mikebom policy init`
  and `mikebom sbom verify --layout`).** Single-step functionary-keyed
  layouts. Multi-step deferred.
- **Feature 006 US3 — real artifact subjects.** Attestation subjects
  are resolved via a 5-stage resolver (operator override → artifact-dir
  walk → suffix match → magic-byte detect for ELF / Mach-O / PE →
  synthetic fallback).
- **Feature 006 US2 — DSSE signing + verification** via `sigstore-rs`
  0.10 (pinned below 0.13 to stay off `aws-lc-rs` per Constitution
  Principle I). `mikebom sbom verify` replaces the never-shipped `sbom
  validate` stub; exit contract: 0 pass / 1 crypto / 2 envelope /
  3 layout.
- **Feature 006 foundation — DSSE verify MVP + witness-v0.1 emission.**
  `mikebom trace run` emits in-toto statements compatible with
  `go-witness` / `sbomit generate`.
- **ClearlyDefined license enrichment.** Post-scan enricher querying
  `api.clearlydefined.io` for `npm`, `cargo`, `gem`, `pypi`, `maven`,
  `golang` components. CD's `licensed.declared` becomes an
  `acknowledgement: "concluded"` license entry. `--offline` disables.
- **Per-ecosystem manifest hashes.** Maven sidecar hashes
  (`.jar.sha512` > `.sha256` > `.sha1`) and PyPI `requirements.txt
  --hash=alg:hex` flags now thread through to `components[].hashes[]`.
- **`metadata.component` carries synthetic `purl` + `cpe`** for sbomqs
  schema validity (`pkg:generic/<name>@<version>` +
  `cpe:2.3:a:mikebom:<name>:<version>:...`).
- **`--include-legacy-rpmdb` flag** (feature 004 US4) enables reading
  legacy Berkeley-DB `/var/lib/rpm/Packages` on pre-RHEL-8 /
  CentOS-7 / Amazon-Linux-2 rootfs. Off by default; also configurable
  via `MIKEBOM_INCLUDE_LEGACY_RPMDB=1`.

### Changed
- **`mikebom trace` reclassified as experimental.** Primary SBOM
  surface is now `mikebom sbom scan`. Trace-mode output format
  (witness-v0.1 + DSSE envelope) remains stable; the capture pipeline
  itself is opt-in, Linux-only (kernel ≥ 5.8), and adds 2–3× wall-clock
  overhead on syscall-heavy builds. Commit `45da74d`.
- **Artifact vs. manifest SBOM scope** is now explicit.
  `sbom scan --image` defaults to artifact scope (on-disk presence
  required). `sbom scan --path` defaults to manifest scope (declared
  deps included). `--include-declared-deps` is the explicit override.
  Gated in three Maven emission paths: deps.dev graph enricher,
  pom.xml direct-dep loop, and the `.m2` BFS cache-miss branch.
- **Dual-identity Maven coords.** JARs at `/usr/share/java/*` owned by
  an OS package-db reader (RPM / dpkg / apk) now emit both identities:
  the `pkg:rpm/...` NEVRA (for distro CVE feeds) and the
  `pkg:maven/<g>/<a>@<v>` GAV (for Maven Central advisories). The
  Maven coord is tagged `mikebom:co-owned-by = rpm` (or equivalent);
  `archive_sha256` is dropped since the archive bytes belong to the
  owning OS component. Pre-fix, the Maven coord was skipped entirely
  under a claim-based heuristic, which cost 53 polyglot GT matches.
- **CycloneDX 1.6 conformance pass.** `evidence.identity` is now an
  array (single-object form deprecated in 1.5→1.6);
  `evidence.identity[].tools` is no longer emitted (the previous
  payload wasn't `tools` by the spec's definition); `mikebom:
  source-connection-ids` + `mikebom:deps-dev-match` now land on the
  component as properties. License shape emits
  `{"license": {"id": "<SPDX-id>"}}` for simple IDs and
  `{"expression": "..."}` for compound expressions.
- **PURL canonicalization.** Qualifiers are now sorted
  lexicographically per purl-spec. `+` is percent-encoded across
  every ecosystem. RPM `epoch=0` is dropped (semantically equivalent
  to no epoch; `rpm -qa` omits it).
- **Compositions emit both `assemblies` and `dependencies`** for each
  `complete` ecosystem record, plus a dep-completeness composition so
  sbomqs's `comp_with_dependencies` credits the primary component.
- **Primary-dependency fallback.** When the scanned project's root
  entry was filtered out (npm `path_key == ""`, cargo `source = None`)
  mikebom now synthesizes edges from the primary metadata.component to
  every orphan root. Without this, sbomqs reported "no dependency
  graph present" even when transitives were populated.
- **OS-release reader** prefers `<rootfs>/etc/os-release`, falls back
  to `<rootfs>/usr/lib/os-release` — fixes Ubuntu images where
  `/etc/os-release` is a relative symlink that dangles after
  tar-extraction.
- **Binary-scanner version-string scanner gated on
  `skip_file_level_and_linkage`** to suppress claimed-binary
  self-identification (curl reporting libcurl from `/usr/bin/curl`).
  Trade-off: static-library version detection inside claimed binaries
  is lost; see `docs/design-notes.md`.

### Fixed
- **Pre-PR verification gate** (Constitution v1.2.1). CI runs
  `cargo +stable clippy --workspace --all-targets` and
  `cargo +stable test --workspace`; skipping either locally before
  opening a PR now yields a reject cycle. Commit `6ec1cf3` (#9).
- **Cross-source deduplication + scan-target filter.** Resolves
  duplicate emissions when the same coord surfaces via multiple
  readers (e.g. Maven JAR walker + `.m2` cache + deps.dev). Commit
  `5c98ed2` (#3).
- **Go `go.sum` vs. BuildInfo divergence.** `go.sum` emissions are
  filtered against the companion binary's BuildInfo so dev-only
  transitives don't surface as runtime components. Commit `5b38b98`
  (#7).
- **Go component name alignment** across the source-tree and binary
  emission paths. Commit `ffa7d9f` (#6).
- **Maven version-aware artifact-presence gate** (M6). Commit
  `b4a9041` (#5).
- **Fat-jar heuristic gated on `co_owned_by.is_none()`** to avoid
  double-reporting. Commit `cb7f14e` (#4).
- **ELF-note ghost emissions.** Previously unconditional — a claimed
  Fedora binary emitted both `pkg:rpm/fedora/<subpackage>` (from
  rpmdb) and a ghost `pkg:rpm/rpm/<source-package>` (from the ELF
  `.note.package` section). Now gated on
  `skip_file_level_and_linkage`; unclaimed binaries respect a
  precedence `note.distro > os-release ID > hardcoded default`.
  Commit `3e5ab91`.
- **Cargo workspace-root false positive.** Commit `3e5ab91`.
- **`declared-not-cached` components dropped from `components[]` by
  default.** They remain in the dependency graph as references but are
  no longer materialized as standalone components. Commit `7688ddb`.
- **sbom-conformance findings + CDX 1.6 evidence serialization.**
  Commit `3cd55e3`.

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] and earlier

Earlier alpha milestones landed as a bootstrap commit
(`b0f31c1 feat: bootstrap mikebom + milestones 001-005`) and ship the
foundational work below. CHANGELOG entries below are a roll-up, not a
per-release breakdown.

### Feature 005 — PURL & scope alignment
- Distro qualifier shape standardized as `distro=<ID>-<VERSION_ID>`
  (matches packageurl-python reference tests); codename-required
  claims dropped from docs + tests.
- npm internals scoping: image scans include
  `node_modules/npm/node_modules/**`; path scans exclude.
  Always-on; not user-gated.
- RPM version-string normalization for canonical round-trip.

### Feature 004 — RPM binary SBOMs
- Standalone `.rpm` file scanning (feature 004 US1/US2).
- Generic binary reader for ELF / Mach-O / PE: linkage
  (`DT_NEEDED`, `LC_LOAD_DYLIB`, PE `IMPORT`) plus embedded
  version-string scanning for a curated 7-library list
  (OpenSSL / BoringSSL / zlib / SQLite / curl / PCRE / PCRE2).
- Legacy Berkeley-DB rpmdb parsing gated behind
  `--include-legacy-rpmdb` (feature 004 US4). Default-off.

### Feature 003 — multi-ecosystem expansion
- Go source + binary readers (`go.mod`, `go.sum`, module cache,
  `runtime/debug.BuildInfo` inline format).
- RPM rpmdb.sqlite pure-Rust reader (page/record/schema).
- Maven pom.xml parser with `<properties>` + `<dependencyManagement>`
  + BOM import resolution (`EffectivePom`, cycle-guarded memo).
- Cargo v3/v4 lockfile parser; v1/v2 refused.
- Gem `Gemfile.lock` indent-6 parser; `specifications/*.gemspec`
  walker catches Ruby stdlib/default gems invisible to Gemfile.lock.

### Feature 002 — Python + npm
- Python venv `dist-info/METADATA` reader; `poetry.lock`,
  `Pipfile.lock`, `requirements.txt` support with dev/prod
  distinction.
- npm `package-lock.json` v2/v3 + `pnpm-lock.yaml` + `node_modules/`
  tree walker. v1 lockfiles refused.

### Feature 001 — build-trace pipeline (experimental)
- eBPF capture of syscall + network events during a build. Requires
  CAP_BPF + CAP_PERFMON and Linux kernel ≥ 5.8. Produces in-toto
  attestations bound to the build event.
